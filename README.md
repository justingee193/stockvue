# StockVue

1. Project Setup:

Create a new Go project directory.
Set up your Go environment and package management using modules.
Create a basic project structure:

stock-market-project/
    ├── main.go
    ├── static/
    │   ├── css/
    │   │   ├── styles.css
    │   ├── js/
    │   │   ├── main.js
    ├── templates/
    │   ├── index.html

2. Backend Development (Go):

Use a Go web framework like Gin or Echo to handle HTTP requests and serve your HTML pages.
Implement routes for various functionalities, such as fetching stock data, handling user authentication, and managing user portfolios.
Integrate with financial APIs or data sources to retrieve real-time or historical stock market data.
Implement data processing and analysis algorithms to calculate indicators, perform predictions, or generate insights.

stock-market-project/
    ├── main.go
    ├── api/
    │   ├── client.go           # API client for making HTTP requests to external APIs
    │   ├── stockAPI.go         # Functions and methods for interacting with the stock-related API
    │   ├── userAPI.go          # Functions and methods for interacting with user-related APIs (if applicable)
    │   └── ...
    ├── handlers/
    │   ├── stock_handler.go
    │   ├── user_handler.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── models/
    │   ├── stock.go
    │   ├── user.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── services/
    │   ├── stock_service.go
    │   ├── user_service.go

    │   ├── stock_repository.go
    │   ├── user_repository.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── utils/
    │   ├── helper.go
    │   ├── validation.go
    │   └── ...

    │   ├── app_config.go
    │   ├── database_config.go
    │   └── ...
    ├── static/
    │   ├── css/
    │   │   ├── styles.css
    │   ├── js/
    │   │   ├── main.js
    ├── templates/
    │   ├── index.html

3. Frontend Development (HTML/CSS):

Design the user interface (UI) for your stock market application using HTML and CSS.
Create HTML templates for different pages like the homepage, stock details page, user dashboard, and portfolio management.
Apply CSS styles to make your UI visually appealing and responsive.
Use CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Tailwind CSS for faster UI development.

4. Interactive Charts (JavaScript):

Choose a JavaScript library for creating interactive charts and graphs. Popular choices include Chart.js, D3.js, or Plotly.
Implement chart components that can display stock price trends, historical data, and portfolio performance.
Update charts in real-time when new data is received from the backend.
Add interactivity, such as zooming, panning, and tooltips, to enhance the user experience.

5. Integration (Backend-Frontend):

Set up APIs on the backend to provide stock data and portfolio information to the frontend.
Use AJAX or Fetch API in JavaScript to make asynchronous requests to these APIs from the frontend.
Ensure proper error handling and data validation in both the backend and frontend to maintain data integrity.

6. User Authentication (Optional):

Implement user registration and authentication if your application involves user-specific features.
Use Go's authentication libraries like Gorilla Sessions or OAuth for third-party authentication.
Protect sensitive user data and ensure secure login mechanisms.

7. Deployment:

Deploy your Go application and static assets to a web server or cloud platform. Popular choices include AWS, Heroku, or a VPS provider.
Set up domain and SSL certificates for secure access.

8. Testing and Quality Assurance:

Write unit tests and integration tests for your backend functions and API endpoints.
Conduct usability testing and gather feedback to improve the user interface.
Perform security testing to identify vulnerabilities and address them.

9. Documentation:

Create documentation for your project, including setup instructions, API documentation, and user guides.
Host your documentation on platforms like GitHub Pages or dedicated documentation services.

10. Continuous Improvement:

Keep your project up-to-date with the latest stock market data sources and APIs.
Monitor and optimize your application's performance and scalability.
Listen to user feedback and consider adding new features or enhancements.
Building a stock market project that incorporates real-time data, interactive charts, and user authentication can be a substantial undertaking. It requires proficiency in Go, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and data visualization libraries. Additionally, staying informed about financial data sources and stock market trends is essential for accurate and up-to-date information.

handlers/: Contains HTTP request handlers that handle incoming requests and route them to the appropriate service.

models/: Defines database schema and models. You can use a Go ORM library like GORM or write raw SQL queries to interact with PostgreSQL.

repositories/: Houses the database interaction logic for specific entities (e.g., stocks, users). Separating this logic from the handlers allows for better code organization.

services/: Contains business logic for different application features. Services orchestrate interactions between handlers, repositories, and models.

static/: Stores static assets like CSS, JavaScript, and images.

templates/: Contains HTML templates for rendering views. You can organize templates based on the functionality they provide (e.g., stock-related templates, user-related templates).

utils/: Contains utility functions and configuration settings.

api/: Contains key files interacting with external APIs. 
- client.go: Contains an HTTP client that you can use to make HTTP requests to external APIs. You can use Go's 'net/http'
package or other HTTP client libraries
- stockAPI.go and userAPI.go: These files contain functions and methods specific to interacting with the external APIs related to stocks and users (if applicable).
You can define functions for making API requests, parsing responses, and handling errors.

When you need to interact with the external API, you can import and use the functions defined in the api/ directory within your relevant handlers, services, or controllers. For example, your stockHandler.go can use functions from api/stockAPI.go to fetch stock data from the external API and then process and display it.

This structure allows you to keep the API-related code organized and separate from your core application logic. It also makes it easier to maintain and extend your project as you may need to interact with more APIs or change the API-related code in the future.
